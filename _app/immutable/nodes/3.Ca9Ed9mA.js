		together to investigate the record-keeping practices of migrant advocates, attorneys, and the
		federal government. It became clear that our era’s so-called “border crisis” is ultimately
		inseparable from the long history of migrations and migration restrictions in the hemisphere and
		throughout the world. This history is amply documented in the approximately 1.6 million public
		domain A-files held by the U.S. National Archives, yet because of the limited information
		available in NARA’s catalog, these files are virtually impossible to explore at scale. (A-files
		enter the public domain when the birth year of the file holder is at least 100 years in the
		past.) A-files open a window into migrant experiences and the operations of the administrative
		state and have exceptional potential for humanities research as well as for explorations in
		personal, family, and community history. The Migrants and the State team is working to harness
		machine learning and data curation methods to increase visibility into the contents of each
		A-file, thus enabling members of migrant communities and scholars to tap into the rich trove of
		information contained within them and understand histories of migration in new ways. While this
		prototype contains XX files comprising XXX pages, we used a training set of xx files totalling
		xxx pages to test and refine our machine learning models.</p> <p class="py-2">Migrants and the State received early stage funding from the NYU Bennett-Polonsky Humanities Lab
		program, NYU Center for the Humanities, and the NYU Office of the Provost Humanities Mega-Grants
		Initiative Seed Fund. The Migrants and the State digital prototype has been made possible in
		part by a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities Digital Humanities
		Advancement Grant program: Democracy demands wisdom.</p> <p class="py-2">Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this web resource do not
