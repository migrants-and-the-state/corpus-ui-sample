		and graduate students came together to investigate the record-keeping practices of migrant advocates,
		attorneys, and the federal government. It became clear that our era’s “border crisis” is ultimately
		inseparable from the long history of migrations and migration restrictions in the hemisphere and
		throughout the world. This history is amply documented in the approximately 1.6 million public domain
		A-files held by the U.S. National Archives, yet because of the limited information available in NARA’s
		catalog, these files are virtually impossible to explore at scale.</p> <p class="py-2">A-files open a window into migrant experiences and the operations of the administrative state
		and have exceptional potential for humanities research as well as for explorations in personal,
		family, and community history. The M/S team is working to harness machine learning and data
		curation methods to enable members of migrant communities and scholars to tap into the rich
		trove of information contained within them and understand histories of migration in new ways.
		While this prototype contains <!> comprising <!>, we used a
		training set of 751 files totalling 37,396 pages to test and refine our machine learning models.</p> <p class="py-2"><span class="italic">Migrants and the State</span> received early stage funding from the NYU Bennett-Polonsky Humanities Lab
		program, NYU Center for the Humanities, and the NYU Office of the Provost Humanities Mega-Grants
		Initiative Seed Fund. The M/S Reading Room digital prototype has been made possible in part by a
